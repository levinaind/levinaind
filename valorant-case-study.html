        <!-- Project Overview -->
        <div class="project-overview">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Valorant is a 5v5 multiplayer character-based shooter developed by Riot Games.
                As of 2022, there are 15 millions monthly active users playing Valorant.
                With the rise of active players, there is also a rise of toxicity within the game.
                In order to reduce the toxic environment players face, I designed a concept to solve
                this issue.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Problem Overview -->
        <div class="problem-overview">
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <h3>How can we implement features to reduce toxicity in Valorant?</h3>
            <p>While Riot Games have implemented a ‘report’ and ‘mute’ feature,
                my challenge is to explore different ways they can implement to reduce
                toxicity in Valorant.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Solution Overview -->
        <div class="solution-overview">
            <h2>Solution</h2>

            <p>I designed a block system where when a user is blocked, it will ensure that
                the user will not be queued in the same team as the blocked user within a week time.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Emphatize</h2>

            <p>Despite being a Valorant gamer myself, I conducted user interviews and
                secondary research from the internet to gain more understanding about how players feel.</p>
            <div class="user-research">
                <h3>User research findings:</h3>

                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    <p>"Even after muting them (toxic teammates), they’ll know, troll around and throw my games."</p>

                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    <p>"I just stop using mic (to speak in game) because my teammates would either
                        harass me or throw the games just because I am a girl."</p>

                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    <p>"I faced a mysoginistic teammate, reported him, and then the next game I was queued into the

                </blockquote>
           


            </div>

            <h3>Secondary Research</h3>
            <p>To validate my findings, I conducted some secondary research through Google, Twitter, and Reddit on the
                Valorant community regarding their experience with toxic players. </p>

            <p>Findings:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    411 300 players have been ‘mic cut’ due to being verbally or textually abusive
                </li>
                <li>
                    A lot of players do not solo-queue (even a <a
                        href="https://twitter.com/RiotSuperCakes/status/1253815812529348608">Riot Developer</a>) because
                    they are scared of
                    being harassed
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Here are the major pain points:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Report system takes time to process - it is not an instant feedback
                </li>
                <li>
                    Players can be queued with the toxic teammates twice in a row, even after reporting
                </li>
                <li>
                    Solo-queue players feel like playing a game of jackpot everytime they queue,
                    as they don’t know their team will be toxic or not
                </li>
                <li>
                    Female players feel scared to use mic, as they are scared to be harassed or get team sabotaged
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <!-- Competitive Analysis Overview -->
        <div class="competitive-overview">
            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>

            <p>I did in-depth research on other first-person shooters game in the market, and find out how they tackle
                toxicity.

                Blizzard’s Overwatch, implements a block system,
                where once a player is blocked, it removes their text and voice chat from being seen and heard,
                but it does not prevent being teamed up with the player. Another feature they implement
                is the endorsement system, where at the end of the game, users can endorse other users that
                makes positive contributions to the match. High-endorsed players will
                get queued with other high-endorsed players which creates an incentive to be a positive teammate. </p>

                I designed the mock up of how it would look like in game.</p>

            <h5>Problem: Players should not get penalized for “dodging” toxic teammates </h5>
            <p>With the Flag teammates system, when players get queued with flagged teammates, it is ultimately
                up to the player to dodge. However, in Valorant, when players dodge a lot of the time,
                they will get penalized. This is not an effective
                solution as players should not get penalized for leaving themselves out of toxic situations.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>User experience design is not always a linear process, since the users are apart of the design
                    cycle,
                    we need to use different approaches to solve a problem.</li>
                <li>Always test my design with real users, because based on the data,
                    I will notice the flaws of my design that I wouldn’t have before.</li>
                <li>Designing the UI of a game is different than the typical mobile app UI, as
                    there is no standardized template that I can refer to.</li>
